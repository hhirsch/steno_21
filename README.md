# Stenography for the 21st century
- multiple dictionaries (languages, os, programming languages)
- fast switching between dictionaries
- javascript to write your dictionary rules

## Implementation

Grab input with [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) or [GTK](http://www.gtk.org)+. [Scim](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SCIM) is a good example but limited to linux. Prefered to run on all operating systems.

## Modality

With modality short strokes can be re-used in modes so you don't end up with one large dictionary but a few smaller ones instead.
